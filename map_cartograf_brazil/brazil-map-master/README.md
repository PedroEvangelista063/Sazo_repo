## Installation

You can either install using a js package manager of your choice or use the official CDN distribution

### via npm

```sh
npm i brazil-map
```

### via yarn

```sh
yarn add brazil-map
```

### via CDN

CDN link via jsDelivr

UMD:

```link
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/brazil-map/dist/brazil-map.umd.min.js
```

ES:

```link
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/brazil-map/dist/brazil-map.es.min.js
```

**NOTE**: The nature of this package is to provide an agnostic web component to work with any other framework and even vanilla js, plus html + css projects, and due to this the `lit` library is imported within the CDN bundle and this can cause bugs if you use another version of lit in your project, the recommended way to use this package in a other lit project is via package manager because they can deduplicate libs and handle this scenario better than a CDN. Otherwise ignore this note if you don't plan to use lit in your project alongside this package.

## Basic Usage

To use the component in your project, first you need to reference the bundle of the lib in your index.html file or the one you wanna use it.

```html
<!-- CDN -->
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/brazil-map/dist/brazil-map.umd.min.js"></script>

<!-- Node modules package -->
<script type="module" src="path-to-your/node_modules/brazil-map/dist/brazil-map.umd.min.js"></script>
```

Then just put the just put the `brazil-component` selector in a `html` page and Voilà! You're done.

```html
<brazil-component id="webrazil"></brazil-component>
```

### Properties

- **hidden-states**: `boolean` - Determine whether or not the states acronyms will be displayed
- **static**: `boolean` - Determine whether or not the map will react to mouse events

To use custom properties, these booleans for example, just insert like a html property in the selector and by default it will be treated like a truthy value internally by lit.

```html
<brazil-component id="webrazil" hidden-states static></brazil-component>
```

### Events

By default, if no static state is applied, a few mouse events occur naturally like the hover over the states strokes and paths in the internal `svg`, and a custom event is dispatched when some path is clicked.

- **onStateSelected**: `CustomEvent<string>` - Dispatch the selected state on the SVG as a custom event. The value is the state acronym `string`(like SP).

```html
<brazil-component id="webrazil" hidden-states static></brazil-component>

<!-- Adding a event listener to the custom element -->
<script>
    const element = document.querySelector('#webrazil');

    element.addEventListener('onStateSelected', (event) => {
        const { detail: state } = event;

        console.log(state) // RJ;
    });
</script>
```

### Custom styles
